# Expenses

A comprehensive web application for personal finance management, expense tracking, and budgeting.

## Description
This project was created to help users track and manage their personal finances effectively. It provides a complete solution for monitoring expenses, managing income, setting budgets, and visualizing spending patterns through detailed statistics and reports.

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI Library**: Mantine UI components
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library

### Backend
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.3.5
- **Language**: Java 17
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Security**: Spring Security with JWT
- **API Documentation**: SpringDoc OpenAPI
- **ORM**: Spring Data JPA

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- MySQL 8.0 or higher

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the `ui` directory:
   ```
   cd ui
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000.

### Backend Setup
1. Configure the database connection in `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/expenses_db
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

2. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

3. Build the application:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   This will start the backend server at http://localhost:8080.

## Testing
- **Frontend Tests**: Run `npm test` in the `ui` directory
- **Backend Tests**: Run `mvn test -Pexecute-integration-tests` in the `backend` directory

## Development
- **Frontend Linting**: Run `npm run lint` in the `ui` directory
- **Frontend Type Checking**: Run `npm run type-check` in the `ui` directory
- **Backend API Documentation**: Available at http://localhost:8080/api-docs when the backend is running

## API Client Generation
The frontend uses NSwag to generate TypeScript clients from the backend OpenAPI specification:

```
cd ui
npm run nswag
```

This generates client code in `src/models/clients.ts` based on the specification in `src/utils/nswag.json`.

## Building for Production

### Frontend
To build the frontend for production:

```
cd ui
npm run build
```

The build output will be in the `ui/dist` directory.

### Backend
To build the backend for production:

```
cd backend
mvn clean package -Pprod
```

This will create a JAR file in the `backend/target` directory that can be deployed to a production environment.

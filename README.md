# Expenses

Web application to manage expenses.

## Description
I created this project because of necessity. I wanted to keep track of my spending so, I decided to create this project. I used Django as the backend and React as the frontend.

The project started using only javascript (frontend and backend), but I decided to change it to use typescript in the frontend and 
java in the backend and unite them in one single repository.

## Features
- Add expenses
- Edit expenses
